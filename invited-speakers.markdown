<summary>**Why language learning is not probabilistic**</summary>

It seems harmless, and certainly mathematically convenient, to treat language learning as acquiring a probabilistic distribution over a space of linguistic patterns. The goal is to find or approximate an optimal hypothesis with respect to the data.  Such is the mainstream machine learning approach, and the so-called Evaluation Procedure in generative grammar can be viewed as a particular instantiation. 

Despite having pursued it vigorously in my earlier work, I now believe this approach is wrong (and wrong-headed). On the one hand, language is not a zero sum game: even overwhelming presence of one linguistic form does not necessarily inhibit or penalize alternative forms. On the other, the grammar can be a partial function: there are inputs for which no output form is acceptable even though some will always be most highly valued in a probabilistic framework.

The alternative is a theory of learning that does not even try to optimize but only sastifice. The coverage of the data only needs to be good enough up to a point; failure to do so may just result in the memorization of the input—nothing in the cognitive system mandates generalization under all circumstances.  I will review the psychological and computational studies of the Tolerance Principle, a parameter-free learning theory that also appears operative beyond the domain of language.

<summary>**“Deficit”, “difficulty”, “difference”: perspectives into autistic people's pragmatic skills and their implications for research methodology**</summary>

It is widely reported that autistic people face pervasive challenges with producing and understanding pragmatics, i.e. context-dependent aspects of language. These are often attributed to challenges with mentalising, i.e. the ability to attribute the correct beliefs and intentions to other people. In this talk I will select influential papers from the past three decades of research in autism and language, each of which reveal a radically different perspective on the architecture of the linguistic system and on what it means to face challenges with linguistic competence (in our case, pragmatics). I will conclude that the recent perspective of neurodiversity implies a radical re-think of how we define pragmatics and how we assess the acquisition and processing of pragmatic competence.
