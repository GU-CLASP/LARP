# CLASP

MILLing is organised by the Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies
in Probability ([CLASP](https://gu-clasp.github.io/)) at the Department
of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science (FLoV), University of
Gothenburg. CLASP focuses its research on the application of
probabilistic and information theoretic methods to the analysis of
natural language. CLASP is concerned both with understanding the
cognitive foundations of language and developing efficient language
technology. We work at the interface of computational
linguistics/natural language processing, theoretical linguistics, and
cognitive science.
