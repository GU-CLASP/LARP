            <h1>Call for papers</h1>
            <p>MILLing will bring together researchers in linguistics and computational
linguistics to discuss learning through linguistic interaction, from
the perspectives of both human language acquisition and machine
learning. We encourage contributions from theoretical linguistics and
experimental linguistics, computational linguistics, machine learning,
philosophy, and cognitive science. We hope to see innovative work that
considers language learning from different perspectives, and we hope
to cultivate discussion that reaches across traditionally disparate
disciplines. Papers are invited on topics in these and closely related
areas, including (but not limited to) the following:</p>
<p>Topics of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language acquisition: formal, statistical, experimental, and corpus-based work</li>
<li>Language learning through dialogue in humans and machines</li>
<li>Multi-modality and figurativeness in language learning and dialogue</li>
<li>Linguistic variation, adaptation, and audience design</li>
<li>Low-resource and ecologically plausible language modelling (e.g., BabyLM)</li>
<li>Cognitive architectures for language learning</li>
<li>Information state update in humans and machines</li>
<li>Second language acquisition</li>
<li>Dialogue systems for language learning</li>
<li>Online, reinforcement and curriculum learning in NLP</li>
<li>Atypical development and language learning</li>
<li>Ethical considerations in AI-assisted language learning</li>
</ul>
