<hr />
<p><em>Multimodality and Interaction in Language Learning (MILLing)</em> will
bring together researchers in linguistics and computational
linguistics to discuss learning through linguistic interaction, from
the perspectives of both human language acquisition and machine
learning. We encourage contributions from the fields of theoretical linguistics,
experimental linguistics, pragmatics, computational linguistics,
artificial intelligence, and cognitive science.</p>
<p>The conference is organised by the Centre for Linguistic Theory and
Studies in Probability (CLASP, <a href="https://gu-clasp.github.io/" class="uri">https://gu-clasp.github.io/</a>),
University of Gothenburg. The conference will be held between October
14 and 15 in Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>

<h2 id="topics-of-interest">Topics of interest</h2>
<p>We hope to see innovative work that
considers language learning from different perspectives, and we hope
to cultivate discussion that reaches across traditionally disparate
disciplines. Papers are invited on topics in these and closely related
areas, including (but not limited to) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language acquisition: formal, statistical, experimental, and machine learning-based work</li>
<li>Language learning through dialogue in humans and machines</li>
<li>Multi-modality and figurativeness in language learning and dialogue</li>
<li>Linguistic variation, adaptation, and audience design</li>
<li>Low-resource and ecologically plausible language modelling (e.g., BabyLM)</li>
<li>Cognitive architectures for language learning</li>
<li>Information state update in humans and machines</li>
<li>Cognitive approaches to second language acquisition</li>
<li>Dialogue systems for language learning</li>
<li>Online, reinforcement and curriculum learning in NLP</li>
<li>Atypical development and language learning</li>
<li>Ethical considerations in AI-assisted language learning</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="submission-requirements">Submission Requirements</h2>
<p>MILLing will feature two types of submissions: long papers and short
papers. Long papers must describe original research, and they must not
exceed 8 pages excluding references (position papers are also accepted
and should be formatted in the same way). Short papers present work in
progress, or they describe systems and/or projects. They must not
exceed 4 pages excluding references. All types of papers will be
published in the 2024 ACL Anthology as a CLASP Conference Proceedings.
Papers should be electronically submitted via the softconf system at:
<a href="https://softconf.com/n/MILLing2024/" class="uri">https://softconf.com/n/MILLing2024/</a>. Submissions should be PDF files
and use the LaTeX or Word templates provided for ACL submissions
(<a href="https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files" class="uri">https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files</a>). Submissions have to be
anonymous. Please make sure that you select the right track when
submitting your paper. Contact the organisers if you have problems
using softconf.</p>
<h2 id="non-archival-track">Non-archival track</h2>
<p>At the time of submission, authors may indicate that their paper should be
considered for the non-archival track. The format for non-archival submissions
is the same for both long and short papers. Non-archival papers will also
undergo peer review.</p>
<h2 id="poster-abstracts">Poster abstracts</h2>
<p>We invite researchers to submit poster proposals in the above areas of
interest. Poster submissions are non-archival. This is a great opportunity to
get feedback on work in progress or to present previously published work to a
new audience. Posters should be submitted by September 13th, 2024, anywhere on
earth. Notifications of acceptance will be sent out by September 16, 2024.
Poster abstract submissions should be PDF files and use the LaTeX or Word
templates provided for ACL submissions
(<a href="https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files" class="uri">https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files</a>). Abstraccts should not exceed 2
pages plus references and be submitted via the softconf system at:
<a href="https://softconf.com/n/MILLing2024/" class="uri">https://softconf.com/n/MILLing2024/</a>. Accepted posters will be presented at the
conference poster session.</p>
<h2 id="concurrent-submissions">Concurrent Submissions</h2>
<p>Papers that have been or will be submitted to other conferences or
publications must indicate this at submission time using a footnote on
the title page of the submissions. Authors of papers accepted for
presentation at MILLing must notify the program chairs by the
camera-ready deadline as to whether the paper will be presented. All
accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the
proceedings. We will not accept publications or presentation papers
that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will
be (or have been) published elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="camera-ready-versions">Camera Ready Versions</h2>
<p>Camera ready versions should follow the same guidelines with respect
to style and page numbers as the initial submission, i.e. there are no
additional pages allowed in the final submission. Please submit the
camera ready version by Sep 20, 2024.</p>
<h2 id="about-clasp">About CLASP</h2>
<p>MILLing is organised by the Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies
in Probability (CLASP, <a href="https://gu-clasp.github.io/" class="uri">https://gu-clasp.github.io/</a>) at the Department
of Philosophy, Linguistics and Theory of Science (FLoV), University of
Gothenburg. CLASP focuses its research on the application of
probabilistic and information theoretic methods to the analysis of
natural language. CLASP is concerned both with understanding the
cognitive foundations of language and developing efficient language
technology. We work at the interface of computational
linguistics/natural language processing, theoretical linguistics, and
cognitive science.</p>
