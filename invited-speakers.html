</summary>
Dan Roth is the Eduardo D. Glandt Distinguished Professor at the Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania and the Chief AI Scientist at Oracle.
Until June 2024 Dan was a VP/Distinguished Scientist at AWS AI.
In his role at AWS Roth led over the last three years the scientific effort behind the first-generation Generative AI products from AWS, including Titan Models, Amazon Q efforts, and Bedrock, from inception until they became generally available.
Dan is a Fellow of the AAAS, ACM, AAAI, and ACL.
In 2017, Dan was awarded the John McCarthy Award; he was recognized for ``for major conceptual and theoretical advances in the modeling of natural language understanding, machine learning, and reasoning’’.
He has published broadly in natural language processing, machine learning, knowledge representation and reasoning, and learning theory, was the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) and has served as a Program Chair and Conference Chair for the major conferences in his research areas.
Roth has been involved in several startups; most recently he was a co-founder and chief scientist of NexLP, a startup that leverages the latest advances in Natural Language Processing, Cognitive Analytics, and Machine Learning in the legal and compliance domains.
NexLP was acquired by Reveal.
